    "## (1) Changes to this document\n",
    "1. <font color=\"red\">(3 Nov 2023 12:315 AM)</font> We have updated the penalty for violating the job constraint (having at least 3 jobs) to be 50% of your \"invitee_num.\" For example, if you invite 36 friends with fewer than 3 jobs, the penalty will be 18. This change is implemented to prevent the scenario where the job constraint is entirely ignored due to too low penalty. Your final grade will be normalized by relative comparison with other students, so this change should not affect your outcome if you have a proper solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. <font color=\"red\">(30 Oct 2023 1:55 PM)</font> Remind on helper class Graph using: To access the graph, you **must** use the function in the helper class Graph, since it will count the number of your access. You cannot create your own functions, access the properties directly, caching the data, or use your own code to prevent the access counting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. <font color=\"red\">(25 Oct 2023 8:35 AM)</font> Score update: The output score when running the main function only has meaning when your result output is not an empty list. When you output an empty list (score = 0), the correctness of your response may vary depending on each test case, and your grade for that test case will be determined through our post-processing. This score is also not the final score you obtain for that test case. It will be relatively compared to the results of other students and normalized to produce the final score for the test case.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. <font color=\"red\">(26 Oct 2023 19:33 PM)</font> Bug fix: Add a clear() function to clear all the lists in g manually after each execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## (2) General Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Requirements (this document) release: 23rd Oct. 2023 (Week 11, Mon)\n",
    "* Deadline: **6th Nov. 2023** (Week 13, Mon) 23:00 hrs. **Late submissions will be awarded zero.**\n",
    "*   Teams: You would have been assigned to a team of <font color=\"red\">2 (or 3)</font> by your faculty. Please check with your faculty/respective TA if you are unsure of your team allocation asap.\n",
    "* Clarifications: questions about the requirements can be sent to senior TA (ydniu.2018@phdcs.smu.edu.sg, qhtruong.2018@phdcs.smu.edu.sg).\n",
    "* This course focuses on improving performance (time taken) via better algorithms, even though the way you write your code may affect performance. Students should not attempt to improve performance by using multi-threading, or multi-tasking (using multiple machines to solve parts of the problem), forwarding the input to a remote server that uses a high performance language to solve or other novel ways that are not algorithm-related. Do clarify with your faculty or Senior TA if in doubt.\n",
    "* Collab already comes with several 3rd party libraries (e.g. pandas, numpy etc.). You are allowed to use these libraries (just insert the correct `import` statement), but do not install (`!pip install`) any other 3rd party libraries in collab even if you know how to. Your solution must work in standard collab. We won't be installing any special 3rd party libraries for you when marking.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## (3) Warning\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cheating, plagiarism and dishonesty will be severely punished and filed officially as a disciplinary record with the University.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Distribution of solutions is equally culpable as the copying of solutions. Do not share solutions/partial solutions with other teams, including posting code at any forum or public code repository (e.g. GitHub with public access).\n",
    "\n",
    "* When in doubt as to whether an action is considered dishonest, do consult your faculty member.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You must acknowledge usage of 3rd party code/libraries in your report.\n",
    "\n",
    "## (4) Deliverablies\n",
    "\n",
    "* You are required to submit to eLearn a single zip file (`Gx_Ty.zip` - where `x` is your section, and `y` is your team number) that contains:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>Your <code>Gx_Ty.py</code> file (containing <font color=\"red\"><code>Invitees(g: Graph)</code></font> function), and\n",
    "<li>a report in the form of a PowerPoint file. You may submit a PDF file or a ppt/pptx file (<code>Gx_Ty.pptx/pdf</code>).\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "* Any member of the team can submit, but only the latest submission (by any member) will be stored and used for grading.\n",
    "* Submission: to eLearn->Assignments. Any member of the team may submit on behalf of the team. You may submit as many times as you wish, but only the last submission is kept on eLearn. The last submission on the deadline will be considered as the final submission that will be assessed.\n",
    "* Your faculty **may** select outstanding teams to present their solution (report) to the class. Please check with your respective faculty concerning this.\n",
    "\n",
    "## (5) Scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "* Weight: This project is worth 20% of your course grade. In some cases, individual members of each team may not be awarded the same score.\n",
    "* Rubric:\n",
    ">1. Quality score (12%). You will get a higher score for a submission with better efficiency or effectiveness performance. Please refer to section (11) for the detailed formula that is used to evaluate your submission.\n",
    ">2. Running time (5%). Your code should **not** exceed <font color=\"red\">more than 1 minute</font> to complete running on colab. If it exceeds this time, your program will be halted, and you will not receive points for that test case.\n",
    ">3. Report (3%)\n",
    "* Scoring is competitive. This means that student's quality score and running time will be compared with other submissions in the whole cohort, and marks awarded based on your relative rank. Students are hence strongly encouraged to attempt a few algorithms and submit the \"best\" one as your final submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "## (6) Report\n",
    "* Cover. Indicate group (`Gx_Ty`) and member names on the cover slide.\n",
    "* Content (max: 3 slides)\n",
    ">* Explain your algorithm and how it works (you may use pseudocode)\n",
    ">* Derive the worse-case Big O time complexity of your algo (show your assumptions and working)\n",
    ">* Focus on clarity\n",
    "* Contribution: Include a slide that shows the specific contribution of each member\n",
    "* References: Include references if relevant. Include URLs if available in your references. You **must** acknowledge usage of 3rd party code/libraries and ideas to avoid plagarism.\n",
    "\n",
    "## (7) Dealing with team issues\n",
    "* One of the objectives of group projects is to learn how to work effectively in a team. Do ensure that all members contribute constructively to the team effort.\n",
    "* If a team member does not contribute or does not respond, please alert your faculty as early as possible so that remediation action can be taken.\n",
    "* You are required to include a section in your project report that briefly describes individual contributions to the project.\n",
    "* After the project deadline, selected team members may be interviewed by your respective faculty. Do preserve evidence of communication and contribution until the end of this term.\n",
    "\n",
    "## (8) Context\n",
    "\n",
    "You have a group of friends, each with their own jobs, such as a programmer, doctor, engineer, and so on. You wish to invite them to a party. While some of your friends get along well and can be invited together, others may have conflicts and should not be invited at the same time. To promote diversity and enrich the discussions at the party, you aim to include friends with at least 3 different jobs in your invitation list. Your objective is to invite the maximum number of attendees while ensuring that no two individuals with conflicts are present together.\n",
    "\n",
    "## (9) Input\n",
    "\n",
    "You will receive a text file (.txt) in the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The first line consists of an integer number, $n$, which indicates the total number of your friends ($1 \\le n \\le 1000$). Thus, the friend index will be 0, 1, ..., n-1.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The second line comprises $n$ integers, $job_{k} (0 \\le k < n)$, each denoting the job of one friend. If there are $J$ total job types, $job_{k}$ should range from $0$ to $J - 1$, $(0 \\le job_{k} < J)$. There are no constraints on the number of job types ($J$), which can be any positive integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each subsequent line contains two different integer numbers, $p$ and $q$, ($p \\neq q, 0 â‰¤ p, q < n$), representing that friend $p$ has a conflict with friend $q$."
